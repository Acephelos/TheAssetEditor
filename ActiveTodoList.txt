Known bugs:
	[DONE]Select face, then swap to vertex mode, need to call update before draw error
	[DONE]Bug with selection in rotation mode, can not select when an axis is active
	[DONE]selecting mesh while transforming the gizmo causes undo to be correct
	[DONE]Gizmo not rendering correctly behind other meshes -> always render last?
	[DONE]Splitting mesh sets wrong offset for gizmo before moved once
	[DONE]Ctrl to multi deselect not working
	[DONE]Using the translate view tool does not make an undo stack
	Selection manager can not select over gizmo when multiselecting
	Gizmo behaves strangly when camera look directly forward towards model
	Selecting not use texture, then deslecting and selecing again gives wrong checkbox value
	Remapping head to lion to h-elf creates index out of range error. Why?
	Saving 2x does not work for text files
