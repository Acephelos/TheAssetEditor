Known bugs:
	[DONE]Select face, then swap to vertex mode, need to call update before draw error
	[DONE]Bug with selection in rotation mode, can not select when an axis is active
	[DONE]selecting mesh while transforming the gizmo causes undo to be correct
	Splitting mesh sets wrong offset for gizmo
	Selection manager can not select over gizmo when multiselecting
	[DONE]Gizmo not rendering correctly behind other meshes -> always render last?
