	Selection manager can not select over gizmo when multiselecting
	Gizmo behaves strangly when camera look d
	irectly forward towards model
	Selecting not use texture, then deslecting and selecing again gives wrong checkbox value	



	


Quality of life:
	Skeleton information view 
	about box - Dont break eula
	Save taxturepaths with slash other way
	Null terminated string somewhere?
	
Animation tool:
	Select and move bones
	Create new bones?
	Create skeleton
		Cicular rotation
		Translation
		Rotate 
	Attachment weapons while playing
	Metadata?
		Animated props
		Transform
		Splice 
	Set mesh
	
	Goals:
		Create pose
			-> new pose
			-> modify pose using transforms
			-> Blend to pose?
		Create mount animations 
			-> follow a node 
		Extract part of skeleton
		Speed up/slow down animation 
		Convert animation between skeletons 
		Easy to work on large datasets
		Create weapon anims 







v10
	Vertex type:
		[Done]Can not change vertex type to cinematic

	Pivot point:
		[Done]AShow pivotpoint crash
		[Done]A"Copy pivot to all" feature
		Round values for pivot points

		[Done]AExtract to own tool
		[Done]ARealtime
		[Done]AView the skeletons
		[Done]AToogle meshes
		[Done]AScale



v11
	Make remapping realtime

Bugs:
	Validation of VMD files
	Generating lods for models with more than 4 lods






	



Animations:
	-->Load all 3k anims
	-->Ensure faulty animations not break the program for ever
	-->Update animation slots
	-->Animation player issues
	Create duplicate of animation bin
	Save bin/frg

	

Kitbashing:
	Selection:
		[DONE]Selection speedup
		[DONE]Dont auto merge "submeshes" when alt is pressed
		Select based on texture?
	Edit with fallof when moving vertexes?
	[Can not reproduce]Ogre bug when merging -> https://discord.com/channels/373745291289034763/795235087352201226/865233241328975912 => I noticed this too, if the paths have different capitalisation or the / 's are the opposite way on two ogre parts using the same texture they will not combine.
	Default to vmd when browsing  in kitbasher -> Type filter
	Improve remapping to handle n meshes and be realtime
	Mesh fitter - Karl franze on humanoid01c
	[Done]Improve remapping to from same skeleton message
	Group devided meshes when large
	[Done]Drag and drop
	Cancel save as error -> Save with name bug to root folder
	
	-->ReTarget mesh to closest vertex 
	-->CampagneAnimation creator

General:
	No packfile selected error - improve
	Enter trigger search in browse dialog
	!Multiple schemas for animation slots
	[Done]Load other games
		[Done]Add 3 kingdoms
		[Done]Add troy 
		[Done]Add rome remastered
	Save packfile memory error?
	[Done]Help link
	

Rendering:
	[Done]Mipmaps
	[Done]Load all texture formats
	[Done]try out new image from phazer
	Tint for selected faces
	[Done]Control light direction and intensity
	[Done]Load three kingodm shit
	--> Change background colour

Changelog:
	Load more texture formats (including bc5 and bc7)
	Use mipmaps when rendering
	Better lighting (thanks to phazer)
	Light controls. PageUp/Down to rotete. Shift + PageUp/Down to controll brightness
	Correctly load and display ThreeKingdom models
	
	Selection related actions greatly improved performance
	Growing selection/splitting into submesh when ALT key is pressed does not auto merge overlapping vertexes (for removing Ogre hats...)
	Drag and drop rmv2, vmd and wsmodels from treeview onto kitbasher to load
	
	Added help link in UI which takes you to the Wiki
	Added possoblity to easily load ThreeKingdoms, Troy and Rome Remastered files (lots of nice animations...)
	
	Fixed crashes in MountEditor tool
