Ensure all components is removed when exiting
	* When looking for files, search ca last -> textures, meshes
	* Loading advance vmds
	* Bondingbox display
	* boundingbox recalc 
	* Make editable as group - import lods
	* Animation modelling
	* TreeView multiselect
	* Disable hotkeys when 3d view not active
	* Disable everything in the UI that is not actually implemented
	* Improve grouping features part 2 - Auto ungroup on combine
	* Improve grouping features part 2 - Save name so multiple refs can be open
	* Sometimes undo for vertex movement does not work
	* splitting repanse removes parts 
	* Quality of life changes for skeleton remapping tool
		- Save thingy actually working
		- Duplicate mesh teaking stuff from, so skeleton names does not change for duplicated meshes
	* Unsaved changes, do you want to exit?	
	* When playing, attach items to props
	* Saving mapping does not work when loading it back in
	* Converte to weighted 4 vertex type
	


Quality of life:
	Flip mesh
	Skeleton information view 
	Snap mesh to skeleteon when mapping
	Improved ws model generation (Facncy mode)
	about box - Dont break eula
	Save taxturepaths with slash other way
	Null terminated string somewhere?
	
Animation tool:
	Select and move bones
	Create new bones?
	Create skeleton
		Cicular rotation
		Translation
		Rotate 
	Attachment weapons while playing
	Metadata?
		Animated props
		Transform
		Splice 
	Set mesh
	
	Goals:
		Create pose
			-> new pose
			-> modify pose using transforms
			-> Blend to pose?
		Create mount animations 
			-> follow a node 
		Extract part of skeleton
		Speed up/slow down animation 
		Convert animation between skeletons 
		Easy to work on large datasets
		Create weapon anims

	-> Mapping from self to self warning -> error at the bottow
	
add a way to multiselect items on model/vmd import
	=> rigkt click context menu import

Fit to skeleton -> allows for -1 in mapping better 




* Press key to toggle "view only selected" (space)
* Shift changed to add to selected, instead of being an or operation
* Right clicking on mesh in a group gives the option of ungrouping it
* Added remove option to Slot and Slots in the tree view for reference meshes
* Wsmodels are now toggled correctly in the tree view
* Re-Rigging can now be undone with ctrl+z
* Escape key closes the open window when trying to add a new reference
* Hot key description added to all items
* Some other bug fixes

* Bmi tool added - Edit volume on a per bone basis 
* Mount animation tool added - Create new mount animations for pretty much anything
* "Tutorials" created. Some help would be greatly appreciated!  https://tw-modding.com/index.php/Tutorial:AssetEditor
