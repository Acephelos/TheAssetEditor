	split hair into group
	Validation:
		Different pivs
		Could be combined
		Empty mesh 
		Vertex weights 
	Mesh without polygons error while generating bb (unsure when and why)
	Distribute leftover weights using ratio instead of average 
	Total vertex and index count 
	
Misc:
	Memory leaks
	Send errors to server?
	Improve saving - invalid folders ((nothing)/nothing)filename.ext)
	about box - Dont break eula
	Thrones of britania loading 
	Added materials and shit as supported text formats 

Animation transfer tool:
	Clear one bone
	Default to generate anim set 
	Set animation length
	Allow for merging of animation
	Scale bone length - usefull for root anims 
	Copy setting to children (force snap, freeze)
	Clear all settings
	Auto select generated animation
	Scale model using matrix, allow save of that scaled mesh 
	
Mount tool:
	Make it eaiser to use
	One click make animpack by combining rider and mount frg. 
	"Add capabilites" function (fire while moving, casting++)
	Auto select generated animation
	
Super view:
	View on mount 
	View matched 
	View riders using attachment system
	Props
	Meta:
		Finish metafile decoding 
		Animated props
		Effects
		Props
		Transforms
		Splice
		Impact pos
		Fire pos 
			
UV editor 
	Select based on UV island 
	Automagically recreate optimized textures -> Texture optimizer tool - Island combiner 
	
Animation bin/frg editor		
Campagin bin editor
AnimBin editor (3k, troy)
Attachment point editor
Pose creator tool (inv kinematic?)
Animated prop tool, not needed?
Skeleton splicer tool?


Campagin map shit?
Sound?
3d texture painter?!

---------Next version

v15
	variantmeshes/variantmeshdefinitions/emp_wizard_light.variantmeshdefinition probability tag
	Save anyway for xml veriantmesh not working

v14
	[X] Better variantmeshdefinition handling => Show errors 
	[X] Validate variantmeshdefinition
	[X] Generic text -> binary editor 
	[X] AnimBin
	[X] TreeView multi select
	[X - can not reproduce] Compagin anims missing from anim search
	[X] Flip left/Right view in rendering
	[X] Scale on mount tool broken?
	[x] Mesh split removes random faces
	[x] ANimated mesh => static prop bugs
	[x] Issue when pressing save in the mesh fitter tool, mesh no longer deforms slightly
	[x] some weight issues fixded
	[x] props during playback
	[x] take pivot into account duing playback
	[X] out of memory excption while saving pack files
	[x] move program to 64bit to enable more memory abuse 
	[x] bone mapping view -> Copy settings to all childre. Clear self 
	[x]lod large 5 models file?
	[x] 	Click select vertexes! 
	[x] Chaos dragon => clicking editbale model changes skeleton to tech skeleton
	
	Erro when combining meshes with more then uint16 parts
	
	Wireframe mode
	Orthigraphic projection
	

	
	Improve frg editor! 
	
	

	[Can not reproduce? ]Weight bug => hu6 skeleton and the mesh was the head from the coatl (well i cut it off by deleting the rest of the body), the head of the lord of change and a piece of equipment from the lord of change
	
	Remapping 
		- Open last setting (auto save to file?)

	Show skeleton in kitbash editor (show weight of selected bone vertexes)
	Search opening folders - Hourglass
	filetypes for browse dialog
	
	Animation transfer tool: - Scale bone length - usefull for root anims 
	Animation transfer tool: - Copy setting to children (force snap, freeze)
	
	vertexes not correct, check empire greatsword weapon (pvito issue for vertex, and bb)

Scale places - Mount tool 




General:
- Generic editor system for binary=>text=>binary 
- Validation of VariantMeshDefinition files on save, with error handling (missing files, incorrect xml) 
- Campagin Bin editor 
- Models are no longer mirrored compared to in game
- Huge improvment to the rendering thanks to Phazer
- Should no longer get out of memory error while saving large files
- Program is now 64bit

Kitbash:
- Multi select meshes
- Splitting meshes into subpart removed random faces
- Convert animated mesh at a pose into static mesh not working
- Fixed some issues with how animation data was calculated. This caused a small (some times huge) error when using the meshfitter or static mesh creator
- Some animation weight issues fixed
- Props are attached during playback
- Pivotpoint is taken into account during playback
- New mapping options in Bone mapping window (clear self, copy self to children)
- Possible to click on vertexes, not just drag selection
- Lod for meshes with 5 lods should work now
- Bug which caused skeleton to change if there was a tech skeleton available 

Mount tool:
- Fixed scale bug
