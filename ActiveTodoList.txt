	[DONE]Gizmo not rendering correctly behind other meshes -> always render last?
	[DONE]Splitting mesh sets wrong offset for gizmo before moved once
	[DONE]Ctrl to multi deselect not working
	[DONE]Using the translate view tool does not make an undo stack
	Selection manager can not select over gizmo when multiselecting
