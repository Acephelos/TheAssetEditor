Take pivot into account when selection

// Texture transfer:
	We could work together on the texture transfer issue, 
	for example, 
	many large mod groups want to transfer their existing assets from Attila/Rome2 into Troy, right?
	And the MAIN problem with that is that Rome2/Attila/ToB
	uses a glossmap with the following channels:
	- glossmap.r = smoothness ( = 1.0f - roughness, if it follow PBR convention fully), this params controls the glossy BRDF (analytical light)
	- glossmap.g = reflectivity  this param controls that sharpness of the IBL relfection, in practice it is kinda of a lerp(diffuse_env_map, specular_env_map, reflectivity)

	whereas in troy, there is only 
	glossmap.r = smoothness which is a proper PBR parameter that affects both the IBL and the the glossy BRDF (analytical light) 
	The most obvious thing would be to just copy the smoothnes param, but i am not sure how that will look.
	Also, you need to gamma correct the Rome2/Atilla/Tob specular and diffuse textures in to SRGB space, as Troy expects textures to be in SRGB color space
